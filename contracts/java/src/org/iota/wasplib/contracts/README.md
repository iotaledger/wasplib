## Java Smart Contracts

Sample smart contracts:

- donatewithfeedback

  Allows for donations and registers feedback associated with the donation. The contract owner can at any point decide
  to withdraw donated funds from the contract.

- fairauction

  Allows an auctioneer to auction a number of tokens. The contract owner takes a small fee. The contract guarantees that
  the tokens will be sent to the highest bidder, and that the losing bidders will be completely refunded. Everyone
  involved stakes their tokens, so there is no possibility for anyone to cheat.

- fairroulette

  A simple betting contract. Betters can bet on a random color and after a predefined time period the contract will
  automatically pay the total bet amount proportionally to the bet size of the winners.

- helloworld

  ISCP version of the ubiquitous "Hello, world!" program.

- inccounter

  A simple test contract. All it does is increment a counter value. It was used to test basic ISCP capabilities, like
  persisting state, batching requests, and sending (time-locked) request from a contract.

- tokenregistry

  Mints and registers colored tokens in a token registry.

### How to create your own smart contracts

Building a Java smart contract is very simple when using an IntelliJ based Java development environment. Open the _java_
sub folder in your IntelliJ, which then provides you with the Java workspace.

The easiest way to create a new contract is to copy the _HelloWorld.java_ file in the _contracts_ package to a properly
named new Java file within the _contracts_ package.

Building the project will compile all smart contracts.

`NOTE: currently there is no way to compile the Java contracts into Wasm. Once this becomes available the intention is that the contracts will simply work unchanged by implementing the Host calls in the client package.`
